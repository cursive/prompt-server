When they are developing medicines, they need to have some way to test whether or not the medicine will work for humans. For years, scientists have tested drugs by using them in various ways on animals. Unfortunately, as a result of making sure a substance is safe and effective for humans, many animals are injured or die. How do you think these situations should be handled? On the one hand, it is bad to make animals suffer, but on the other hand, scientists need to conduct these experiments to show that the medicines people use are safe and effective. After conducting your own research, take a position on this topic and write an essay stating your position and explaining why it is the better one. Use relevant evidence from reliable sources for each side, pointing out the strengths and limitations of both sides of the issue.\n\nHERE IS THE STUDENT’S ESSAY: \nIf someone in your family has a disease like cancer, heart conditions, and AIDS they may have to suffer pain and change their lifestyle. But they only are alive because of medicine. Back when medicine and vaccines weren’t invented or that advanced, diseases like Polio, Malaria, Asthma, etc., killed many people. Even getting a cold or fever could kill you. Nowadays all the medicines save many lives, but they are killing, too. \n\nAll these vaccines weren’t tested on other humans, but on animals. Everything from mice to polar bears, new ways of saving people are tested first on animals. Animals that can’t speak or argue about us humans killing them. They have no say in living or dying. On average 20 million animals are killed through this testing. Many of them don’t get pain killers when they are slammed on the head, or get their legs chopped to see if they can adapt. \n\nThat’s because a painkiller can affect the research and can mess up the reactions. Is it fair to test an animal get tested like this? Many scientists argue that it is necessary to save lives. The question is, are we the ones to chose who lives and who dies? Are we the ones to kill in order to increase our lifespans? \n\nWe should work toward ways to decrease animal testing and find other ways that don’t involve such pain and killing. It should be worked out so that a company can use only a certain number of animals a year. Also, we could use a computer program that acts just like an animal with all of it’s behaviors and reactions. If it gives bad results, they can keep working until it says it’s ok. When that is done, they could use only a few animals to see if it worked. This would reduce the chance of animals getting killed. \n\n" }, { "uuid": "ef21fe61-1e85-4967-8ac0-5167930fa9a5", "title": "My name", "author": "Joe", "date": "2023-05-19T01:00:02.766Z", "description": "Here are some details" }, { "uuid": "974a7041-44a0-4951-877a-809e661ec05a", "title": "Test prompt", "author": "Daniel", "date": "2023-05-19T01:16:59.407Z", "description": "Here is my tesxt fdsf" }, { "uuid": "cb4a9089-e423-4200-be47-1c371362964f", "title": "Blah", "author": "Blabla", "date": "2023-05-19T16:17:36.012Z" }, { "uuid": "d304b474-17c0-424b-a9d4-9d75083e002c", "title": "Dantest", "author": "Daniel", "date": "2023-05-19T16:18:08.938Z" }, { "uuid": "d8eba610-416a-4b6e-be73-92e4118d0a60", "title": "Dantest", "author": "Daniel", "date": "2023-05-19T16:19:39.286Z" }, { "uuid": "2ffeb9ac-a1c7-4ba2-b7b1-f3d2c74438d3", "title": "fdds", "author": "fdsfds", "date": "2023-05-19T16:26:10.981Z" }, { "uuid": "a9ba2957-e187-4cc4-ba82-9d5d4fec0697", "title": "dsa", "author": "dsa", "date": "2023-05-19T16:26:38.953Z" }, { "uuid": "4b39d4a2-1bdd-4393-91db-24ff1aab1523", "title": "9th Grade Persuasive 2.1", "author": "Jessica", "date": "2023-06-08T22:25:19.433Z", "description": "WHO YOU ARE:\nYou are a challenging and rigorous high school English teacher.
