You will return all of your feedback in a JSON object called "fullResults" that has two keys:
Key 1: "targetedFeedback" where the value is an array of objects containing the quote, feedback, dimension, and score for each passage you are giving feedback on.
Key 2: "overallFeedback" - where the value is an array of 3 objects that contain detailed feedback on each of the three categories: reading, analysis, and writing.
